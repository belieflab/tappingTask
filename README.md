# Tapping Task

## Overview

**Speed Tapping** 
Participants are instructed to press the spacebar with their index finger as many times as they can in 10 seconds. They are instructed to start with their dominant hand and then switch hands after each trial. The participant is shown a picture of how to position their hand during the experiment. 

First participants will see a countdown on the screen, when they see “Go!” they should start tapping and stop when they see “Stop!”

_Approx run time: 5 minutes_

**Tempo Tapping** 
Participants will see a countdown of 10 and hear a tone. They are instructed to press the spacebar at the same tempo as the tone they hear during the countdown. After the countdown they will see a “+” sign and will be required to continue tapping at the same tempo but without hearing the tones until they see the screen that says “Stop Tapping!” 

_Approx run time: 5 minutes_

**Variable Tempo Tapping(vtt)**
This task is the same as the one above except participants will be required to change the tempo at which they tap. 

_Approx run time: 20 minutes_
